# Friend Function in C++

A **friend function** in C++ is a non-member function that has access to private and protected members of a class. It is declared with the `friend` keyword inside the class whose private data it needs to access.

---

## Key Features of Friend Function
1. **Non-Member Function**: A friend function is not a member of the class, but it can access the private and protected members of the class.
2. **Declared Inside the Class**: It is declared inside the class using the `friend` keyword.
3. **Defined Outside the Class**: The actual function definition is outside the class body.
4. **No `this` Pointer**: Since it's not a member function, it doesn't have a `this` pointer.

## Syntax
```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

class Box {
    double width;

public:
    // Constructor
    Box(double w) : width(w) {}

    // Declare a friend function
    friend void displayWidth(Box b);
};

// Friend function definition
void displayWidth(Box b) {
    cout << "Width of box: " << b.width << endl; // Access private member
}

int main() {
    Box b(10.5);
    displayWidth(b); // Call friend function
    return 0;
}
