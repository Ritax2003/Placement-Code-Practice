/*
You are given a binary string S.
You can perform the following operations on S any number of
times (possibly zero):
• Select an index i such that S[i] is equal to
1 and S[i+1] is equal to 0 for 0 ≤ i < len(S) -1.
• Remove exactly one of the character from S.
Find the smallest string S that you can get after performing
operations on S.

Note:
• If there are multiple smallest strings possible then return the
string which is lexicographically smallest.

Constraints:
• 1 <= len(s) <= 10^5
• 1 <= 𝐴[𝑖] <= 10^5

Sample Input 10000111111
Sample output 1
0000111111
Explanation-1
Here, S = "0000111111" We cannot perform any operation on S so it
remains unchanged

Sample Input 2
1111111
Sample output 2
1111111
Explanation 2
Here, S = "1111111" There exists no 0 in S so we
can not perform any operation on S. Hence, S is
equal to "1111111".


Sample Input 3
110
Sample output 3
0
Explanation 3
Here, S = "110" We can perform two operations on S as :- 1. Select the
index 1 and 2 and remove the character at index 1. Then S becomes
"10". 2. Select the index 0 and 1 and remove the character at index 0.
Then S becomes "0". Hence, S after performing operations is equal to
"0"
