### 23\. What is CSS?

[CSS](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/css-tutorial), which stands for the Cascading Style Sheets. It helps to design and style the web page to make it attractive for users. CSS provides us a lot of selectors to select the HTML elements and style them according to the requirements. Some of the [****CSS selectors****](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/css-selectors) are [Element Selectors](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/css-element-element-selector), [****Class Selectors****](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/css-class-selector) and [****Id Selectors****](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/css-id-selector).

### 24\. Explain selectors in CSS.

In [CSS, selectors](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/css-selectors) are used to select elements and style the element by providing CSS properties to it. Below is the list of some common CSS selectors:

### 26\. What are the best practices for using JavaScript and CSS?

The best practices for JavaScript and CSS can be defined according to the project requirements. Below are some general best practices listed for JavaScript and CSS:

*   Always use an external file for defining the JavaScript and CSS with ****.js**** and ****.css**** extensions respectively.
*   Always link the CSS file inside the <head> tag of the HTML document.
*   Always add the script file at the end of the <body> tag just before where body closes.
*   Try to write JavaScript in strict mode to avoid errors and write cleaner JavaScript.
*   Avoid creating global variable and use the meaningful name to define the variables.

### 27\. What is difference between visibility: hidden and display: none properties in CSS?

The ****visibility: hidden**** property only hides the content of the element on which it is used. It does not removes the element from the document and keep the space as it is so that no other element can replace it on the UI. On the other hand, the ****display: none**** property not only hides the element but removes it from the document and the space acquired by the element is now free to be acquired by the other elements.

### 28\. Mention the issues faced by developers while running the CSS in Internet Explorer (IE)?

Below list shows the issues faced by the developers in Internet Explorer:

*   Transparency of the images with ****.png**** extension.
*   Issues related to Z-index property.
*   Sometimes, it doubles the margin added to an element.
*   Box model has a different interpretation.
*   Lack the support for the CSS3 Features.

### ****29\. Explain box-model in CSS.****

The box model in CSS is basically a blue print of an element with some properties. The box model contains four elements which are content, padding, border and margin.

*   ****Content:**** It can be the text content or the nested HTML elements with some content inside a element.
*   ****Padding:**** It is the space around the content of the element or the space between the content and the borders.
*   ****Border:**** This is the stroke or outline provided to the element to see its boundaries or style it.
*   ****Margin:**** It is the space around the whole element, it is the gap outside the element from other elements or the space between the border of this element and other elements.

### 30\. What is the purpose of z-index property in CSS?

The ****z-index**** property is used to control the stacking order of the elements that are positioned using the ****position**** property in CSS. The higher or the positive values will make the element appear on the top of the other elements while the negative or the lower values make them appear behind the elements with higher values.

### 31\. What is the use of float property?

The ****float**** property allows to set the child elements of a container either on the left side of it or at the right side of it. The possible values for this property are ****left, right, initial, inherit,**** and ****none.****

### 34\. What are pseudo classes and pseudo elements in CSS?

The pseudo classes and pseudo elements are different entities in CSS. They are combinely known as pseudo selectors in CSS. Below is the explanation for them:

*   ****pseudo classes:**** These are the classes that selects the elements based on their state and the position. Some pseudo classes are ****:hover, :focus, :nth-child etc.****
*   ****pseudo elements:**** These are the virtual elements that are mainly defined to style a particular part of an element in the HTML document. Some pseudo elements are ****:before**** and ****:after.****

### 35\. Why is the ‘!important’ used in CSS?

The ****!important**** declaration is used to give higher precedence to a CSS property to override it from other conflicting styles defined on a element using the same property such as ****width: 30px !important;**** will override the property ****width: 25px;**** defined on the same element.

### 36\. What is the purpose of ‘box-sizing’ property in CSS?

### 40\. Describe CSS sprites and their importance to improve website performance.

CSS sprites are a technique that is used to compress multiple images available on the web page into a single image file. It arranges all the images in a grid-like layout. The ****background-position**** property of CSS can be used to display the different parts of the combined image as background for different elements. It improves the web performance by reducing the server requests as the website has to request only a single image now instead of requesting multiple images.

Front End Developer Interview Questions for Experienced
-------------------------------------------------------

### 43\. What is JavaScript?

JavaScript is a high level scripting language. It is a dynamically typed language. JavaScript is used to add the dynamic elements and styles to the HTML document to make the web page more interactive and attractive. JavaScript is used in both frontend as well as backend.

There are a lot of frameworks and libraries of JavaScript available that can be used in frontend like ReactJS, Vue.JS, AngularJS, NextJS etc. There is only one framework of JavaScript available for the backend development which is Node.JS.

### 44\. What is difference between == and === in JavaScript?

The ****\==**** operator is known as the double equal to operator in JavaScript and ****\===**** is the triple equal to operator. Both of these operators are the comparison operators and used to compare the values of the operands. These operators are almost same, there is only one difference between them. The == operator checks only for the values of the operands and return true if the values are same. On the other hand, the === operator not only checks for the values of the operands but also for the types of the operands. It returns true only if the values and the type of the operands is same.

```
3 == "3" // Returns true
3 === "3" // Returns false


```


### 45\. How to defer an element’s event handler if it depends on an external script that takes some time to load?

In order to defer the event handler of an element if it depends on an external script that takes some time to load. You can use the ****defer**** attribute inside the script tag while adding the external JavaScript file. The ****defer**** attribute confirms that the script will be executed after the HTML gets parsed.

```
<script src='external-script-file.js' defer></script>


```


Now, you need to attach the event listener to the element dynamically. In order to wait for the external script file load, we can attach the ****load**** or the ****DOMContentLoaded**** events before executing the script and once the loading is completed, you can attach the event listener to your element by checking any function or variable from external script, whether it is loaded or not and run the code with respect to it. Refer the below code for understanding:

```
document.addEventListener('load', function(){
    if(typeof coder === "boolean"){
        const myBtn = document.getElementById('myBtn');
        myBtn.addEventListener('click', function(){
            console.log("Button is Clicked!!");
        })
    }
})


```


In above code, we are assuming the the external script file contains a variable ****coder**** of boolean type and using this variable to check whether the external script is loaded or not.

### 46\. Optimal strategy for winning a game where let’s say, I start with 1, opponent can cite a number X within the range \[2, 11\]. Then I have to say a number in the range \[X + 1, X + 10\], then opponent, then me, and so on. Whoever says 100 in the end wins and the game ends.

The optimal strategy for winning this game is to put your opponent in a situation where they have no choice to say some number that is closer to 100 and then you have 100 in the range from that number + 1 to that number + 10, so that you can say 100 first and wins the game.

### 47\. Why would you use the prototype in JS?

The prototype is a very important and fundamental concept of JavaScript. It is the basic concept of the Object Oriented Programming and the prototype chain. The below list involves some reasons of using prototype in JavaScript.

*   To modify the properties and methods of an object dynamically.
*   Used in inheritance implementation.
*   To allow the sharing of properties and methods of an object.
*   JavaScript is a prototype based language.
*   Prototypes can be used to create shared methods that can save memory.

### 48\. What is the meaning of ‘this’ in JS?

The ****this**** keyword in JavaScript is a identifier that based on the scope of the function or variable from which it is invoked. The scoping behaviour of this keyword changes based on the scope where it is used. At the global level ****this**** keyword refers to the global ****window**** object. In below example, the ****this**** keyword will refer to the scope of the object whose function is called:

```
const myObj = {
    name: "GeeksforGeeks",
    stats: function(desc){
        this.desc = desc;
    }
}
console.log(myObj.stats("A Computer Science portal for Geeks."));


```


### 49\. Namespaces in JavaScript

Namespaces in JavaScript are the basic programming paradigm that provides encapsulation to some variables of functions. So that, if the functions and variables with same names are defined the program at some other place do not collapse and work as expected. You can also use the objects to achieve the same effect.

```
//Declaring namespace
let myNamespace = {
    nameSpace: "Creating a name space in JavaScript"
}

//Accessing namespace identifiers
console.log(myNamespace.nameSpace);

//Output: Creating a name space in JavaScript


```


### 50\. Difference between null and undefined in JS.

The ****undefined**** and ****null**** are basically the values that the variables or function gets by default. The meanings of both these values are different do not use these values interchangeably.

****Undefined Value:****

*   The undefined is the default value that is assigned to an variable which is declared but not initialized.
*   It is also the default return value of a function.
*   When you try to access some value or property that is not in the part of object, it returns undefined.

****Null Value:****

*   It can be assigned to an variable to make it an empty variable.
*   It represent that the accessing variable is not present in the code.

### 51\. Explain closures in JS with an example of statements in loop

A closure in JavaScript forms when a function is defined inside another function or returned by a function. The ability of inner function to remember its scope and the scope of its parent function’s chain is known as closure. A closure function can access the variables of its parent function even if it gets executed.

```
function sum(a){
    return function sum2(b){
        return a+b;
    }
}

for(let i=1; i<=5; i++){
    console.log(sum(i)(i+1));
}


```


### 52\. What is event loop in JavaScript?

JavaScript is a synchronous and single threaded language, that means JavaScript executes the code line by line in one go and do not wait for any code to get execute. The event loop is a mechanism built in JavaScript engine to handle the asynchronous tasks efficiently. The event loop continuously check the ****call stack**** and the ****callback queue.**** If it finds that the call stack is empty, it immediately pushes the asynchronous task from the callback queue to call stack to get executed.

### 53\. Explain hoisting in JS?

Hoisting is a concept in JavaScript, which allow us to access or extract the values of the functions and variables even before initializing or assigning values to them. The reason behind this is the allocation of memory to the variables and functions during the first phase of execution.

```
console.log(hoistedVariable);  // Undefined
var hoistedVariable = 25;
console.log(hoistedVariable); // 25


```


### 54\. What are different Data types in JS?

JavaScript is a dynamically typed language, that means unlike the other programming languages like C, C++ the type of the variables is decided at the run time instead of the compile time. In JavaScript, there are two types of data types available:

*   ****Primitive Data type:**** These are the predefined data types like ****string, number, boolean, undefined, null, BigInt etc.****
*   ****Non-Primitive Data type:**** These are the data types that are derived from the primitive data types like ****arrays**** and ****objects.****

### 55\. If the typeof(\[\]) is object, then What is the content and the length of b in below code?

```
let b = [];
b.v = 10; 
b.push(11);


```


Arrays in JavaScript are a special kind of data type which can hold the numerical values and the values with key as well. In the above code,

*   the line ****var b = \[\],**** creates an empty array,
*   then the line ****b.v=10,**** adds a key in the array with a value of 10 and
*   finally the line ****b.push(11),**** pushes the numeric value 11 to the array.

It makes the content of the array as: ****\[11, v: 10\],**** and the length of the array as 1, because these is only one numeric value present in the array.

### 56\. Different ways to create objects in JS?

In JavaScript, we can create objects using the different syntaxes. Below are some ways to create object in JavaScript:

*   ****Using Object Literal****

```
let obj = {}


```


*   ****Using construction function****

```
function Student(name, class){
    this.name = name;
    this.class = class;
}
let obj = new Student("Neha", 8);


```


*   ****Using Object.create() method****

```
const obj = Object.create(prototype)


```


*   ****Using Class****

```
class Student{    
    constructor(name, class){
        this.name = name;    
        this.class = class;
    }


}

let obj = new Student("Neha", 8);


```


*   ****Using Object constructor****

```
let obj  = new Object();
obj.name = "Neha";


```


### 57\. How to implement inheritance in JS?

In JavaScript, the inheritance can be implemented in two different ways:

*   ****Prototypal Inheritance:**** It can be implemented as shown below.

```
// Parent constructor function
function Student(name) {
  this.name = name;
}

// Adding a method to the prototype of the parent
Student.prototype.getName = function() {
  console.log('My name is ' + this.name);
};

// Child constructor function
function Rahul(name, std) {
  // Call the parent constructor using call or apply
  Student.call(this, name);
  
  // Add properties specific to the child
  this.std = std;
}

// Inherit from the parent prototype
Rahul.prototype = Object.create(Student.prototype);

// Add a method specific to the child
Rahul.prototype.speak = function() {
  console.log('Hello World!');
};

// Create an instance of the child
const myObj = new Rahul('Rahul', '8th');

// Access inherited method from the parent
myObj.getName(); // Output: My name is Rahul

// Access method specific to the child
myObj.speak(); // Output: Hello World!


```


*   ****Class based Inheritance:**** It uses the Object Oriented Programming Concepts of JavaScript and inherits properties of parent class using the ****extends**** keyword as shown below.

```
class Parent{
    // Some properties
}
class Child extends Parent{
    // Some properties
}

```


### 58\. Explain call(),apply() and bind() methods in JavaScript.

These methods are in-built JavaScript methods and used to call the functions with the specified context and the ****this**** value of the context. These methods can also be used to set the value of ****this**** keyword to some other context while invoking the functions.

*   ****call() method:**** It is used to call the functions with a specified ****this**** identifier value and individual multiple arguments.

```
let myObj = {
    implementCall: function(name, desc){ 
        this.name = name;
        this.desc = desc;
        console.log("Implementing Call method");
        console.log(this.name, this.desc);
    }
}
let func = myObj.implementCall;
func.call(this, "GeeksforGeeks,", "A Computer Science portal for all geeks");

```


*   ****apply() method:**** The apply() method in JavaScript is almost same as the call() method, there is only one difference between them, that is the apply method allows you to pass multiple arguments together to the function in the form of an array.

```
let myObj = {
    implementApply: function(name, desc){ 
        console.log("Implementing Apply method");
        console.log(name, desc);
    }
}
let func = myObj.implementApply;
func.apply(this, ["GeeksforGeeks,", "A Computer Science portal for all geeks"]);

```


*   ****bind() method:**** The call() and apply() methods invokes the function immediately after the application but the bind() method is used to bind a function to some variable with the passed parameters and the scope of ****this**** identifier, so that the function can be called later when you need to call it.

```
let myObj = {
    implementApply: function(name, desc){ 
        console.log("Implementing Bind method");
        console.log(name, desc);
    }
}
let bindedFunc = myObj.
implementApply.bind(myObj, "GeeksforGeeks,", "A Computer Science portal for all geeks");
bindedFunc();

```


### 59\. What is event delegation in JavaScript?

Event delegation is a technique in JavaScript that is used to improve the performance and reduce the memory usage of our website by attaching a single event listener to the parent in the case when you need to attach event listeners to each child of that element. You can handle the changes on the website by using only one event with the parent element.

### 60\. Tell me about key features of JavaScript.

There are many features provided by JavaScript, some of them are listed below:

*   It is a Single threaded language.
*   Dynamic variable typing.
*   Prototypal and classical inheritance
*   First class functions
*   Higher order functions.
*   Hoisting and closures etc.

### 61\. What is the use of “use strict” directive in JavaScript?

The ****use strict**** directive is used to write the clean JavaScript code which is less prone to errors. It catches common coding errors like assigning a variable without declaring it or passing different parameters with same names to a function etc.

### 62\. What is event propagation in JavaScript?

Event propagation defines the behaviour how the events will propagate when they are attached with the child and the parent elements. There are two ways in which events can propagate.

*   ****Event Bubbling****
*   ****Event Capturing****

### 63\. Define event bubbling in JavaScript?

Event bubbling is the process in which the event propagate from the target element back up to its ancestors in the DOM tree that means if the innermost element is clicked the event will travel up to the outermost ancestor or the parent element in the DOM tree. It is the default behaviour of the event propagation.

### 64\. What is event capturing?

Event capturing is just opposite of the event bubbling. The event propagate from the outermost element to the innermost element in this case. It can be enabled by passing an extra parameter as true to the ****addEventListener()**** method at the time of attaching an event.

### 65\. What are callback functions in JavaScript?

A callback function in JavaScript is a function that can be passed as an parameter to another function and then it is the responsibility of that function to call it later at some time. For Example: ****addEventListener()**** method takes a callback function and calls it when the passed event occurs, ****setTimeout()**** method also takes a callback function which will be called later once the passed time period expired.

### 66\. What is callback hell and how to avoid it?

Callback hell refers to a situation in which multiple nested callback function are used i.e. a function contains multiple nested functions and all of them are called by passing a callback function as parameter to them. It is mainly occurs when you are dealing with asynchronous operations. ****Promises**** and ****async/await**** statements can be used to avoid callback hell.

### 67\. Explain Promises in JavaScript.

A Promise is an object that represents the completion or failure of an asynchronous task and its resulting value according to the status. There are three states of an promise:

*   ****pending:**** It is the initial state in which promise is neither rejected nor fulfilled.
*   ****fulfilled:**** It represents the successful state of the promise where it completes the task.
*   ****rejected:**** It represents that the asynchronous task gets failed.

### 68\. What is the use of async await in JavaScript?

The ****async**** statement is used to represent the asynchronous task that takes sometime to get resolved. While, the ****await**** statement is used to wait for a promise or asynchronous task to resolve or fulfill to continue the asynchronous function execution.

### 69\. Explain the concept of currying in JavaScript?

Currying is a technique which is used to transform a function that takes ****n**** parameters into a chain of ****n**** functions in which each function contains only one parameter.

```
function normalFunction(a, b){
    return a*b;
}
normalFunction(3, 2) // Output: 6

function curryingFunction(a){
    return function(b){
        return a*b;
    }
}
curryingFunction(3)(2); // Output: 6


```


### 70\. What is the purpose of passing defer or async attributes to the script tag?

The ****defer**** and the ****async**** attributes are used to load the script in a particular manner as explained below:

*   ****defer:**** It parallely fetches the HTML and script, once the whole script is fetched it stops fetching HTML and executes the script first, then again starts fetching HTML and execute it once it is completely fetched.

```
<script src="script_file_path" defer></script>


```


*   ****async:**** The async attribute makes the server to fetch the script and HTML parallely and once it fetches both of them it starts executing script and only after that it will execute the HTML.

```
<script src="script_file_path" async></script>


```


### 71\. Explain try catch block in JavaScript.

The try and catch blocks are used to efficiently handle the different states of an operation. The ****try block**** checks the code written inside it for the errors. If the code executes with errors the ****catch block**** catches that error and display them to the user. Otherwise, the code written inside the try block for the successful condition will executes.

```
try{
    // try block code
}
catch(error){
    // Show errors to users
}


```


### 72\. How to stop event propagation in JavaScript?

There is a in-built method [****e.stopPropagation()****](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/html-dom-stoppropagation-event-method) provided by the JavaScript events which can be used to stop event propagation. The method can be implements as follows:

```
element.addEventListener('event', function(e){
    e.stopPropagation();
})


```


### 73\. [How to prevent the default behaviour of a event in JavaScript?](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/how-to-prevent-the-default-action-of-an-event-in-javascript)

The [****e.preventDefault()****](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/preventdefault-event-method) is a in-built method provided by JavaScript that can be used to prevent the default behaviour of an JavaScript event.

### 74\. Describe the concept of CORS?

CORS stands for ****Cross-Origin Resource Sharing****. It is a technique used by the browsers to make our web page more secure. The web browsers use this feature to prevent requests from one domain to another domain.

### 75\. Explain debouncing in JavaScript?

It is a technique used to improve the performance of the web page by ensuring that the time consuming tasks do not fire so often in the code. One use case of debouncing is to handle the situation in which frequent server requests are made evertime a key is pressed. For Example: ****search functionality on different web pages.****
