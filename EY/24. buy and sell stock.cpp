/*
In daily share trading, a buyer buys shares in the morning and sells them on the same day. 
If the trader is allowed to make at most 2 transactions in a day, the second transaction can only start after the first one is complete (buy->sell->buy->sell).
The stock prices throughout the day are represented in the form of an array of prices. 

Given an array price of size n, find out the maximum profit that a share trader could have made.

Example 1:

Input:
n = 6
prices[] = {10,22,5,75,65,80}
Output:
87
Explanation:
Trader earns 87 as sum of 12 and 75. Buy at 10, sell at 22, Buy at 5 and sell at 80.

Explanation
Initialization:

leftProfit[i] stores the maximum profit achievable by making a single transaction from day 0 to day i.
rightProfit[i] stores the maximum profit achievable by making a single transaction from day i to the last day.
Calculate Left Profits:

Loop from the beginning to the end, tracking the minimum price seen so far.
For each day i, leftProfit[i] will hold the maximum profit that could have been achieved by completing a transaction by that day.
Calculate Right Profits:

Loop from the end to the beginning, tracking the maximum price seen so far.
For each day i, rightProfit[i] will hold the maximum profit that could have been achieved by starting a transaction on that day.
Combine Profits:

For each day i, combine leftProfit[i] and rightProfit[i] to get the maximum profit possible with two transactions.
The maximum of these sums across all days will be the answer.
Complexity Analysis
Time Complexity: 
ùëÇ
(
ùëõ
)
O(n), where 
ùëõ
n is the number of prices, since we make three passes over the array.
Space Complexity: 
ùëÇ
(
ùëõ
)
O(n) for the leftProfit and rightProfit arrays.
